# BrawlItOut

A prototype made for the Human Computer Interaction course. 
An android application/game that uses Haptic, Tactile and Gestural Interfaced to let people play against each other. The name derives from the idea that a trivial dispute in a gruop can be easly set by a challenge in this game.

The fist who make this move won. Let's Braw It Out.
